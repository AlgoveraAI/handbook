**Which course?** Openmined’s [Foundation of Private Computation](https://courses.openmined.org/courses/foundations-of-private-computation)

## About the course

“Become a data scientist and statistician capable of studying data you do not own and cannot see. Learn every major privacy-preserving technique to an intermediate level, understand how they work together, and how you can use them to safely study data owned by another organization (such as another university, enterprise, or government) without ever seeing the underlying data yourself.”
