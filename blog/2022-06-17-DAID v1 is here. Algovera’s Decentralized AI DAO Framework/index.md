Imagine running and funding your own decentralized AI-model project, making your choices in data, AI training and creating positive impact to many communities! And eventually becoming your own sovereign AI-driven DAO.

Trying to decentralize AI development from Tech giants or Military who currently dictate which AI projects get funded, is not a simple task. 

This is why, we at Algovera have developed a decentralized AI DAO Framework to help you to reach your goals faster. 

**DAID framework** consist of 4 key areas:

1. Design Thinking: who is the user and who is impacted by my AI model?
2. Decentralized AI tools: from data sourcing, storage, training, deploy to publishing AI models to market places
3. Creating sustainable commercial value
4. Web3 for decentralized AI teams: covers how to set up a DAO, governance, proposals, treasury management and member protection

**DAID Workshop:**

Format: Faciliated online workshop

Time: 2x 1hours
