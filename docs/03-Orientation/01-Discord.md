Discord currently functions as Algoveraâ€™s community hub, and is the first place to communicate with fellow members of the Algovera community. If you have a question or want to follow updates from Algovera, then Discord is the place for it. 

Discord is also an ideal place to discuss ideas for projects, join a squad, or chat about Web3! Feel free to jump in to channels that match your interests and start getting involved!

We recommend following the steps below when first joining our Discord server:
In the #2-introductions channel, give a brief introduction about yourself, tell us a bit about your interest and what brought you to Algovera. 
Assign yourself a role by reacting to the message in the #3-roles channel.

Have a look through the channels and get a feel for what is being discussed in each channel. Join in on the conversation!
