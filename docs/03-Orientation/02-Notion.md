The Algovera notion site serves as a database for the Algovera Community. You can find information about past events, links to resources, active projects within the community, and a directory with active contributor information. Notion is a great place to start if you want to dive into our resources and current projects happening in the community.

We are always updating our notion site and adding new information, if you find anything that needs to be updated or changed, please contact an admin in Discord!
