Hacking sessions are hands-on meetings where members of a “Squad” can get together for tandem coding and concrete planning.

Hacking sessions are meant to be productive, and to help organize squad members toward completion of a specific goal. It is recommended that Hacking Sessions stay as organized and focused as possible to ensure proper progress toward the Squad goal. These sessions are open for everyone to join.

Similar to Juntos, hacking sessions are recorded for posterity and can be found on our Notion page at the link below: https://algovera.notion.site/Hacking-Sessions-02efbffcdae340cb93b39c57c18a9b9d
