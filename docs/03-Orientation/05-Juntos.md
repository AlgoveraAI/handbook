Juntos are meant to be informal discussion sessions where the wider community can get together on a video call and discuss particular areas of interest. Although Juntos are less structured than townhalls or hacking sessions, we believe they provide an essential forum for open discussion and exploration within the community.

Juntos are recorded so community members that were not present can still engage in the material. You can find recordings of all Juntos on our Notion page here: https://algovera.notion.site/Juntos-acd3375453d548e18f9da18e83415aaf
