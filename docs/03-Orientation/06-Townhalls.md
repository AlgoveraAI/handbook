Our weekly townhalls are broken down into two main sections - Updates and Plans. The Algovera Core Team will share out relevant updates on pending action items in each Townhall in an effort to keep the broader community informed.

Additionally, the Core Team will share out plans for the upcoming week - these plans can include action items the core team is working on, as well as important upcoming events or milestones.
