Here we'll list a step-by-step guide to help you get from community member, to contributor, to paid Squad member. Let's dive in!

1. Check out the #1-start-here channel for general information about Algovera, as well as some helpful resources!
2. Drop a quick introduction about yourself in the #2-introductions Discord channel - While this is optional, it is highly encouraged as it will help build community connection.
3. Select your role in the #3-roles channel in discord. By indicating your skillset and interest area through Discord roles, other members in the community will be able to seek you out for your expertise, or invite you to a Squad or Pod!

4. Add yourself to the Community Directory using [this form:](https://airtable.com/shrQPjhE9wxHbWKL2). The community Directory is used to communicate interest and availability in joining existing Squads, or starting new ones. A robust entry in the community directory will open up crucial opportunities to find open projects and paid work within the community - we highly recommend you take the time to fill our this form!

5. Sign up for [Intros.ai](https://profile.intros.ai/join/algovera.ai) : Intros.ai provides an interactive and automated platform to make personalized and high quality introductions to community members. These introductions are made on your terms, and you can select the criteria of the people you want to be introduced to, as well as how often you want to receive recommendations.

6. Complete this Orientation! Onboarding to a Web3 community can be confusing at first, though we've created this resource and our several "Tracks" to make it as easy as possible to jump in to the community, contribute your skills, and get paid!
