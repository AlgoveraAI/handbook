## Discord

Discord currently functions as Algovera’s community hub, and is the first place to communicate with fellow members of the Algovera community. If you have a question or want to follow updates from Algovera, then Discord is the place for it.

Discord is also an ideal place to discuss ideas for projects, join a squad, or chat about Web3! Feel free to jump in to channels that match your interests and start getting involved!

We recommend following the steps below when first joining our Discord server:

1. In the #2-introductions channel, give a brief introduction about yourself, tell us a bit about your interest and what brought you to Algovera.
2. Assign yourself a role by reacting to the message in the #3-roles channel.

Have a look through the channels and get a feel for what is being discussed in each channel. Join in on the conversation!

## Notion

The Algovera notion site serves as a database for the Algovera Community. You can find information about past events, links to resources, active projects within the community, and a directory with active contributor information. Notion is a great place to start if you want to dive into our resources and current projects happening in the community.

We are always updating our notion site and adding new information, if you find anything that needs to be updated or changed, please contact an admin in Discord!
