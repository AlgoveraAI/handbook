We envision a world where independent AI developers have the freedom to work on projects that they’re passionate about. These AI developers would keep ownership of their ideas and inventions, receive rewards based on their contributions and acquire passive income based on the value generated by their creations.

The Algovera grants program is for projects that combine AI and Web3 values. There is **$10,000** worth of grants on offer each round with $3000 of this curated by the Algovera core team. The maximum grant for each individual project is $1000 (e.g. to fund one month of part-time work).

On our journey to date, we’ve realised that achieving our vision requires adopting several new technologies. **In general, it needs to be easier for independent developers to launch useful AI apps** and we’ve identified a few things that we think might help. For example, datasets need to be more accessible and permit use for commercial purposes. The privacy of the data owners should be better preserved using maturing private AI technologies. It should also be easier to coordinate and collaborate among distributed teams using tools such as shared treasuries, governance mechanisms and project tracking. Marketplace infrastructure (such as [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com/)) should be available for quickly advertising and monetising processed data, algorithms and apps. And finally, cheap storage and compute resources should be more widely available for training models and storing data and weights. We strongly encourage projects that align with this vision to apply.
