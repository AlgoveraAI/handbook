We are interested in funding **any and all** projects that use AI. The projects can be open or closed source, product or research-focused and built using any infrastructure. Previous grants that the community has voted to award have included:

- AI apps (e.g. web apps, Gradio/Streamlit/HuggingFace apps, plugins) 
- AI workflows and assistants (e.g. notebooks, [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) scripts, prompt engineering) 
- AI models (e.g. fine-tuning on new data)
- early-stage AI startups
- AI research (e.g. towards academic publications or conference papers)
- open source AI software 
- projects building AI x Web3 infrastructure
- mechanism design for AI apps and systems (e.g. simulations for distributing value generated by AI)
- AI courses
- Outreach to AI communities or consumers
