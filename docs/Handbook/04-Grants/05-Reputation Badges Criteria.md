### Contributor

Any community Member who has generated a [Cred Score](https://cred.algovera.ai/#/explorer) above 10 during the previous month or is a member of a newly funded Squad in the last month will receive the Contributor Badge. Cred Scores are calculated using default weights in SourceCred, and you can view the Algovera SourceCred graph here. We are constantly exploring ways to more accurately leverage SourceCred, so if you donâ€™t think SourceCred is accurately representing your contributions please contact us in Discord and we can help troubleshoot!

*Note: We use NFTs for badges, since it puts the user (and not the issuer) in control. This means you would be able to use our Reputation Badges outside of our ecosystem in future.*
