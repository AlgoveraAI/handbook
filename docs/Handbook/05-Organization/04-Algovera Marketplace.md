<!-- 
There is a strong open source ethos, online presence and passion for good in the AI community (e.g. HuggingFace, EleutherAI). However, workers tend to contribute to these projects on evening and weekends, while sustaining themselves with salaries from tech companies. Can new mechanisms of funding free more people to work full time on open source and AI for Good?

Our mission is to empower data scientists to work for themselves on their own ideas and keep ownership of their creations.
