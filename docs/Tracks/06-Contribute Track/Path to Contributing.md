There are lots of things going on at Algovera. We are looking for contributors to be part of the Decentralised AI movement. If you are interested in contributing, these are the steps to follow:

1. Register your interest using [this form](https://airtable.com/shrAd3x6fNLAyZJiK).
2. Schedule initial meeting with core team using this [link](https://calendly.com/richardblythman). 
3. Brainstorm ideas together and come up with objectives for contributing.
4. If contribution involves setting up a new pod, outline objectives for the pod. Discuss the missing roles within the pod and advertise to the community.
5. Keep communicating with the community/core team about your progress.

We have created a [Contribute Board](https://algovera.notion.site/Contribute-Track-5fede47954e847d5a498626f9f436ac3) that shows volunteering opportunities to help the Decentralized AI movement at Algovera.
